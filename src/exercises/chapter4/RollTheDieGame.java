/*
 * The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
 * Roll the die for the user and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board.
 * After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.
 * Repeat this 4 additional times for 5 rolls in total.
 * However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - theyâ€™ve won.
 * If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.
